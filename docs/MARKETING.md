### r/thevillages (Primary Target)

**Title:** Free rental listing site for Villages homeowners - no subscription fees

**Body:**
```
Hey neighbors! I built a free alternative to the paid listing sites for renting out your Villages home.

**What it does:**
- List your rental property for free
- Renters browse and contact you directly
- No subscription fees, no booking commissions
- Simple and mobile-friendly

**Why I built it:**
I was frustrated that existing sites charge monthly fees just to list a rental. Seemed like there should be a free option.

**Looking for feedback:**
If you rent out your home (or are looking for a rental), I'd love your thoughts on what features would be most useful.

Site is: [RentDirect55.com]

Anyone interested in trying it out as an early user? Happy to answer questions.

### r/FloridaRealEstate

**Title:** Built a free rental listing platform for 55+ communities - feedback welcome

**Body:**
```
I've been working on a niche rental platform focused on 55+ active adult communities, starting with The Villages in FL.

The idea: property owners list for free, renters browse and contact owners directly. No middleman fees.

Competing against sites that charge $100+/year subscriptions. My angle is freemium - basic listings are always free, premium features (more photos, featured placement) for $9.99/mo.

Questions for this community:
1. Is there demand for this in other FL 55+ communities?
2. What features would make you switch from existing platforms?
3. Any legal considerations I should be aware of?

Would appreciate any feedback from folks who know this market.

### r/realestateinvesting

**Title:** Launching a rental listing platform for 55+ communities - seeking feedback on the business model

**Body:**
```
I'm building a rental listing marketplace specifically for 55+ active adult communities (The Villages, Sun City, etc.).

**The model:**
- Free tier: 1 listing, 3 photos, 90-day duration
- Premium: $9.99/mo for unlimited listings, featured placement, analytics

**Why this niche:**
- Large addressable market (The Villages alone has 150k+ residents)
- Underserved by major platforms (Airbnb/VRBO take 3-15% fees)
- Existing niche competitor charges subscription but hasn't innovated in years
- Strong seasonal demand (snowbirds)

**Questions:**
1. Does the freemium model make sense, or should I go subscription-only?
2. Any experience with rental platforms in retirement communities?
3. What would make you list a property here vs. Zillow/FB Marketplace?

Appreciate any insights from folks who've built or invested in marketplace businesses.
